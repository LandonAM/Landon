# Cartizon World
The world of fantasy and adventure, full of wonder and danger. To the east, a fantastical land of wonderment and weird. To the West, a harder land, where adventurers make names for themselves, and war is always on the brink.

Where will you land?

That depends.

How do you want to do this?
